What I was doing is not right
Thanks to the sunmountain from newlisp bbs
you helped me a lot.
also thansk to lutz,the creator of newlisp, I cost you so much time,lol

as far as now
I imported libfcgi to get it work
single process verion ,I need more tests to decide the multi process version

Now I am running it with spawn-fcgi
#spawn-fcgi -p 9000 -f /tmp/fcgi.lsp
In a month,today is my lucky day.
